        "The goal of this project is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten different categories using a fully connected (Dense) neural network architecture. CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.\n",

        "This project demonstrates how a simple fully connected neural network can be applied to the CIFAR-10 image classification problem. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are more commonly used for image classification, this model achieves reasonable performance and illustrates the workflow from data preparation to evaluation using Keras and TensorFlow."
